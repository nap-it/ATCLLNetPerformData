# ATCLL Network Performance Data

This repository contains data acquired in both a real outdoor ITS-G5 network and a commercial cellular 5G network in the city of Aveiro. This data made it possible to carry out the work entitled **"Machine Learning in the management of VANETs"**. The ITS-G5 network is composed of eleven stationary nodes and eight mobile nodes. The cellular network is composed of commercial cell towers and one mobile node. The architecture of the performed tests is described in the following figure.

This data is divided into two datasets, one for ITS-G5 and another for cellular. These datasets include mobile and stationary node identification information, test location information, signal strength information and network performance information. Both datasets only include information relating to periods of connectivity and periods of non-connectivity are not present, as they have a low relevance.
